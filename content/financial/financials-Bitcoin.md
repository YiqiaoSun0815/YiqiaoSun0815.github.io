summary: "Why Bitcoin’s traditional four-year return pattern is breaking, and what this means in a world of debt, regulation, and generational change."
---
For years, Bitcoin followed a pattern that many investors took almost as a law of nature.
After each halving, the next three years delivered positive returns, while the fourth year turned negative. It wasn’t just a cycle — it became a mental model.

That model seems to be chanllenged after 2025.

This time, Bitcoin didn’t wait neatly for the script. Prices moved earlier, drawdowns behaved differently, and the “bad fourth year” no longer looks inevitable. The reason isn’t technical — it’s structural.

Bitcoin now exists in a chaotic world.

Global economic growth is slowing. Major economies are carrying historically high debt levels. Governments are far more sensitive to inflation, interest rates, and financial stability than they were a decade ago. At the same time, U.S. financial institutions and Wall Street have entered the market in a serious way, changing both liquidity and behavior.In my opinion,Bitcoin has became another manipulated "tool" and yet "bomb".

The concession of economy and high debt level often comes with war,but due to nuclear weapons,the world is more peaceful than ever.But the call of clearing debt is imminent,which caused the rise of nationalism.

Add stablecoins into the picture, and Bitcoin is no longer an isolated crypto experiment — it’s part of a broader financial ecosystem.

There’s also a generational element. For younger people, traditional paths to wealth feel narrower: housing is expensive, real wages are pressured, and asset ownership is increasingly out of reach. Bitcoin, with its low entry barrier and global access, naturally absorbs some of that demand.

My personal view is this: Bitcoin is likely to gradually stabilize. Not in the sense of becoming boring, but in the sense that extreme boom-and-bust cycles may soften over time. Volatility should decline, though meaningful upside opportunities will still exist.

That also makes Bitcoin a prime target for regulation. Not because it’s disappearing, but because it’s becoming an elephant in the room.

As an economic phenomenon, Bitcoin is no longer just about price.
It’s about debt, trust, access, and how financial systems adapt under pressure — and that’s what makes it truly interesting.
