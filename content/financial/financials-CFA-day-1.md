Simple interest and compound interest describe two different ways interest is calculated over time, and the difference between them becomes significant as the time horizon gets longer.

Simple interest is calculated only on the original principal. The formula is:

Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

For example, if you invest 1,000 at 5% simple interest for 3 years, the total interest is
1,000 × 5% × 3 = 150, so the final amount is 1,150. Interest does not earn interest.

Compound interest, by contrast, is calculated on both the principal and previously earned interest. The standard formula is:

FV = PV × (1 + r)ⁿ

Using the same example with annual compounding, the future value becomes
1,000 × (1.05)³ ≈ 1,157.6. The difference looks small here, but it grows rapidly with longer maturities or higher rates.

From a CFA perspective, the key insight is that compound interest is the default assumption in finance, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Bond pricing, equity valuation, and capital budgeting all rely on compounding. Simple interest appears mainly in short-term instruments or simplified exam questions.

A common mistake is assuming that “5% for 10 years” means adding 50% to the principal. That logic only applies to simple interest. Another frequent error is ignoring the compounding frequency—annual, semiannual, or monthly compounding all lead to different outcomes.

My point is that compounding is not just a calculation detail; it is a powerful force. If anyone want to make profit in the long term,the most important point is don't lose principal,risk always come first.
