Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about building my own *mental* FOF — not an official fund, just a structured way to watch and allocate assets that actually matter in the next decades.

My current watchlist is simple but intentional.

First, **physical gold ETFs**. Not because I’m obsessed with inflation headlines, but because gold still functions as the ultimate balance sheet hedge when trust breaks down — trust in governments, currencies, or systems.Besides,the central banks of big countries are consistantly buying gold,especially China,in order to decouple with America.

Second, **energy ETFs**, with a strong focus on **electricity**. Power generation, grids, and storage are no longer boring infrastructure topics. Electricity is becoming the backbone of everything: AI, data centers, automation, mobility, even geopolitics. Whoever controls stable and scalable energy controls real leverage.The drastic rise of energy price in Europe is the best exmaple of it.

Third, **Bitcoin**. I don’t see it as a replacement for state currencies. I see it as an independent form of global computation and settlement — a kind of digital reserve that sits outside traditional political systems. Volatile, yes. But strategically important.

Beyond that, I keep an eye on **industrial metals** like copper and tungsten. I don’t chase them aggressively, but I’m happy to buy them on dump. These materials quietly sit behind electrification, defense, and industrial reshoring. They’re boring — until suddenly they’re not.

At a deeper level, my thesis is simple:  
The next phase of competition between major powers is no longer just about who prints the dominant currency. It’s about **energy, computation, and real productive capacity** — assets that can be priced in national currencies, but are not *created* by them.

For ordinary people, social mobility is getting harder, not easier. The gap is structural. If you only rely on labor income, you’re increasingly replaceable — by automation, by cheaper labor, or by systems that don’t need you at all.

Early exposure to assets tied to energy, computation, and scarce resources isn’t about getting rich fast. It’s about not sliding into a future where you’re just a disposable work unit.

This is how I’m trying to think ahead — quietly, imperfectly, but intentionally.
