## 1) Portfolio Snapshot (Week 2026-W04)

**Holdings**
- **CHSPI** (Swiss market): slightly up / mostly sideways  
- **150C** (S&P 500 CHF-hedged): broadly flat, tracking US equities  
- **QDVE** (US tech): mild pullback / consolidation  
- **PPFB** (Physical gold): relatively strong and resilient  

**One-line summary:**  
Defensive layers did their job, growth assets paused, and hedges quietly worked in the background.

## 2) What Moved This Week (Drivers)

### Macro / Rates / FX
- Markets continued to price uncertainty around interest rates and growth rather than clear directional conviction.
- CHF remained relatively firm, reinforcing the value of currency-aware positioning.

### Equity factors (risk-on / risk-off)
- Risk appetite softened slightly, favoring broad indices and defensive exposure over high-beta segments.
- No panic, just selective de-risking.

### Gold / non-sovereign assets
- Gold benefited from cautious positioning and persistent macro uncertainty.
- This looked more like structural demand than speculative buying.

## 3) Holding-by-Holding Notes

### CHSPI
- **What happened:** Slight gains with limited volatility.
- **Why:** Swiss large caps continue to act as a stability anchor in uncertain environments.
- **What I’m watching:** Global risk sentiment spillover and defensive sector leadership.

### 150C (CHF-hedged S&P 500)
- **What happened:** Largely flat, moving with the S&P 500.
- **Why:** US equities consolidated while currency hedging muted FX noise.
- **What I’m watching:** Whether US earnings and macro data shift market expectations meaningfully.

### QDVE (Tech)
- **What happened:** Mild pullback after prior strength.
- **Why:** Valuation digestion and sensitivity to rate expectations.
- **What I’m watching:** Whether this remains a healthy consolidation or turns into broader sector weakness.

### PPFB (Physical Gold)
- **What happened:** Held value well and showed relative strength.
- **Why:** Demand for non-sovereign assets in an uncertain macro regime.
- **What I’m watching:** Real yields and risk sentiment rather than short-term price moves.

**What I changed this week:**  
- No changes.

**What I did not change (and why):**
- Core positions remain aligned with my long-term structure: stability, computation, and non-sovereign hedges.

## 6) Personal Reflection

This week also triggered several forward-looking thoughts about potential adjustments, even though no action has been taken yet.

First, I’m seriously considering **increasing exposure to emerging markets, especially China**.  
The slowdown — or even stagnation — in the real estate sector, persistently low deposit rates, a strong policy bias toward stability, and a visible improvement in domestic confidence have all contributed to a powerful equity rally.  
That said, current valuations already reflect a lot of optimism. My preference would be to **wait for a meaningful pullback, around 15%**, before initiating or increasing exposure.

Second, I continue to monitor **energy and electricity-related assets**, a structural gap I have been planning to fill for some time.  
Interestingly, this week the power and utilities segment was relatively inactive — neither breaking down nor attracting strong inflows. This looks less like weakness and more like a pause, likely due to unclear rate expectations. I plan to observe this space for another week before making any decisions.

Third, I intend to **keep my US exposure unchanged**.  
In my view, both US equities and government bonds carry elevated bubble risks. While the US remains structurally important, I’m not optimistic about its short- to medium-term risk-reward profile at current levels.

Finally, I’m evaluating whether to **increase exposure to continental Europe**, particularly Germany and France, in addition to Switzerland.  
As geopolitical tensions intensify, leading EU economies may increasingly rely on financial markets to support strategic sectors. I see potential tailwinds especially in **financials and industrial completion / infrastructure-related sectors** if this dynamic plays out.

Overall, these are not tactical trades, but structural considerations.  
Patience, sequencing, and valuation discipline matter more than speed.
