I begin to learn how to use AI tools to improve efficiency and build my own project.
Today's learning begins with PowerShell.
Often used command:
-cd:to enter a catergory
-ren:to rename
-dir:to list all files and folders of current folder
I created my local configuration files (.toml and .yml) then uploaded to my github project.

Today's question:
Why I created a new post txt file and rename it with ".md" suffix but powershell can't identify it?
Answer:
The actual suffix of the new post file is still ".txt" because I created it with text document formula.The actual name is still "xxx.md.txt".
Solution:
1.Creat new post with powershell using command.Under the content folder and type "New-Item content\posts\xx-xxx-xxxxx.md".
2.In Windows Explorer, check the "Show file extensions" option.And creat new post file using txt formula then rename it to "xxx.md".

Daily thought:Can I just combine AI tools with regulatory compliance requirement?How to process the data without risk leaking information?
