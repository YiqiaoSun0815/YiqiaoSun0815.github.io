High Risk Doesn’t Always Mean “No” — A Practical AML Judgment Case in my daily work

In my recent work, I assessed a corporate client that, at first glance, looked like high-risk customer that should be eliminated.

The ultimate beneficial owner is a PEP, and the ownership structure is deliberately complex. While the controller is not listed on OFAC’s SDN list, the structure clearly appears designed to reduce direct exposure to sanctions risk. On top of that, the company produces a "dual-use product", which naturally raises additional concerns from both AML and sanctions perspectives.

Based on these factors alone, it would be easy to reach a quick conclusion: too risky, eliminate the relationship.

But AML risk assessment is not about shortcuts — it’s about **substance over labels**.

After digging deeper, several mitigating factors became clear:

* The PEP, while politically exposed, is **not subject to sanctions**, and there is no evidence of sanctions evasion,hidden designated parties or persons acting joingly.
* Dual-use products account for **less than 1% of total revenue**, and the company holds valid **export licenses**.
* The business operates transparently and complies with **Swiss legal and regulatory requirements**, including trade controls.
* No adverse media or red flags indicating corruption, terrorism financing, or illicit diversion of goods were identified.

Taking all this into account, I still classified the client as **high AML risk** — but importantly, *high risk does not automatically mean prohibited*.

My conclusion was that the institution can **continue providing services**, provided that enhanced controls are in place:

1. **Adequate and high frequent KYC reviews**, not just periodic box-ticking.
2. **Stricter transaction monitoring**, with a focus on payment purpose, counterparties, and economic rationale.
3. **Ongoing review of business activity**, especially any changes in revenue composition or export destinations.
4. **PEP watchlist**,review the UBO on a periodically basis to see whether he/she recevies any further santcions and judge accrodingly.
5. Clear internal escalation rules if the dual-use segment expands or if the ownership structure changes.

This case is a good reminder of something we often forget under regulatory pressure:
AML is not about eliminating risk — it’s about **understanding, managing, and documenting it**.

Blanket de-risking may feel safe, but it can also mean abandoning sound judgment. A defensible, well-documented decision — even for a high-risk client — is often the more professional approach.

Dig deeper and think rationally.
