Update: When a Same-Name USD Transfer Is Still Rejected

Following my earlier post on a USD rejection case, there has been a further development that effectively brings the assessment to a conclusion.

As part of a controlled diagnostic approach, I requested the client to initiate a same-name USD transfer — deliberately chosen to eliminate trade background, counterparty, and structuring variables.

That transfer was also rejected by the USD clearing bank.

Why this result is decisive

A same-name transfer is oa clear test:

No third-party beneficiary

No underlying trade or commercial rationale to assess

No pricing, goods, or services risk

No counterparty sanctions exposure

When such a transaction is still rejected, the interpretation becomes very clear:

The rejection is client-level, not transaction-level.

At this point, technical explanations, documentation gaps, or enhanced trade narratives are no longer relevant.

What this tells us about the risk

This development confirms several points that my previously assumptions:

USD clearing is structurally unavailable for this client
The clearing bank’s position is not conditional, temporary, or transaction-related.

The issue is no longer within the bank’s control
No amount of internal review, clarification, or remediation can override a correspondent bank’s risk appetite.

Continuing USD attempts would create risk per ce
Proceeding despite repeated correspondent-level rejection would be difficult to justify from an audit or regulatory perspective.

How I view the appropriate response

Given this outcome, the prudent course of action is:

Formally acknowledge that USD services are not available for this client, due to clearing bank constraints

Cease further USD transactions.

Since my client relationship still needs maintainance,strictly limit transaction to non-USD currencies, with enhanced due diligence and monitoring.


Takeaway

This case reinforced a practical lesson:

In any inter-bank transactions, correspondent bank behavior is often the most reliable risk signal.

A rejection of transaction per ce is a highlighted red flag,especially with a complex backgrounded entity.

At that point, good risk management is not about pushing harder or asking better questions —
it is about recognizing that the infrastructure itself has drawn the line.
