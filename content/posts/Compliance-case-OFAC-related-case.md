A USD Rejection Case: How I Assessed the Risk Beyond Sanctions Lists

I recently handled a USD payment case that, in my view, highlights how risk signals in correspondent banking are often misread when we focus too narrowly on sanctions lists.

This post summarizes the business background, transaction flow, my assessment logic, and the key takeaway.

Business background

The client is a long-standing customer of the bank.
Its UBO is a Central Asian national.

In 2018, the client was subject to a Swiss government investigation related to Russia-linked business activities. The investigation was eventually closed without sanctions,or penalties.

From a purely legal perspective, the case appeared resolved. The client continued to operate and maintain banking relationships.

What triggered the issue

Recently, the client initiated a USD payment via our bank.

The transaction was rejected by our USD clearing bank without any further instructions.It's a signal per se.

Shortly afterwards, all subsequent USD outgoing and incoming transactions related to this client were consistently rejected

The clearing bank cited “compliance reasons”

Upon further inquiry, the clearing clarified that the case was "not reported to OFAC" and refuse to make any comments.

Separately, I conducted independent screening:

The beneficiary showed no OFAC or public sanctions exposure

The beneficiary’s UBO also not listed on OFAC listing

No obvious transaction-level red flags were identified

The client’s request was clear: restore USD payment and collection capability.

Why “not reported to OFAC” raised, rather than reduced, concern

In day-to-day USD operations, ordinary, low-risk transactions do not involve OFAC at all.
Rejections typically relate to:

Technical issues

Incomplete information

Routine AML or transaction monitoring reviews

When a correspondent bank explicitly mentions OFAC — even to state that a case was not reported — it indicates that the transaction or client has already been assessed within a sanctions-risk framework.

This suggests proximity to sanctions risk, even if formal escalation thresholds were not met.

In other words, this was no longer a “normal” USD rejection.

My risk assessment

Based on the overall pattern, I concluded that continuing normal USD business with the client was not appropriate at this stage, for three reasons:

Historical sovereign investigation remains a durable risk factor
Even without enforcement outcomes, prior investigations — especially those linked to Russia-related activities — tend to remain permanent risk markers in correspondent banking.

Central Asia is structurally sensitive in the current sanctions environment
Regardless of individual client intent, the region is often viewed by USD clearing banks as elevated risk due to geopolitical alignment and potential sanctions circumvention concerns.

Persistent rejection indicates a client-level decision
This was not a one-off transaction rejection, but a repeated blocking of all USD inflows and outflows — a strong signal that the correspondent bank had taken a client-level risk decision, independent of public sanctions lists.

My approach: pause, test, observe

At the same time, I did not think an immediate, irreversible exit decision was necessary.

Instead, I opted for a controlled diagnostic approach:

I requested the client to initiate a same-name USD transfer

The purpose was purely analytical:

If the transfer is rejected, this would confirm that the client is effectively blocked at correspondent-bank level

If the transfer is executed, this would suggest a transaction-specific issue rather than a full client-level exclusion

Only in the latter scenario would continued USD service be considered — and only with enhanced trade background verification, stricter counterparty due diligence, and ongoing monitoring.

Takeaway

This case reinforced a key lesson for me:

In USD clearing, sanctions lists are only the visible surface.
The more important signals often come from clearing bank,or even other bank's behavior.

When a bank,especially USD clearing bank consistently rejects transactions and explicitly references sanctions frameworks, ignoring that signal is itself a risk decision.

Effective risk management is not about proving that a client is “clean”,
but about recognizing when the financial infrastructure itself is signaling unwillingness to intermediate the risk.

Sometimes, the most prudent decision is not to push harder —
but to pause, test, and listen carefully to what the system is already telling you.

Overall,the risk lies in any tiny-tiny daily operations,keep an eye on any abnormalties.
