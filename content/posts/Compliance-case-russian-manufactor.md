To Onboard or Not? When “Not Sanctioned” Is Not the End of the Analysis

I was recently approached by a mid-sized company seeking onboarding, with anticipated needs for letters of credit and trade finance discounting.

At first glance, the case appears manageable:

The UBO is a Russian national, but not listed on any sanctions registry

The company operates two main business lines:

Purchasing metal bars from Russia for processing

Selling the processed products in Switzerland /EU

The transaction structure appears commercially logical

No immediate red flags show up in sanctions screening

Yet I find myself hesitating.

Not because something is clearly wrong —
but because nothing is clearly safe either.

The first concern: “Not sanctioned” does not mean “no sanctions risk”

The UBO is not designated under any sanctions.

However, in the current geopolitical environment, the absence of listing is not a definitive comfort.

Two structural risks remain:

Future designation risk
Russian nationals with international commercial exposure remain within potential scope of future sanctions expansion.

Indirect exposure / proxy risk
The possibility — however unproven — that an unlisted UBO could be acting as a commercial proxy (“white glove”) for sanctioned interests cannot be fully dismissed in certain sectors.

While there is no evidence of misconduct, sanctions risk today is increasingly about trajectory and exposure, not just current status.

The second concern: Sector and transaction sensitivity

The company purchases metal products from Russia, processes them in Switzerland, and sells in Switzerland/EU.

On paper, the trade flow is legitimate.

However, metals originating from Russia are a structurally sensitive commodity category, and trade finance changes the risk equation:

Letters of credit create documentary reliance risk

Discounting creates pre-payment and recourse exposure

The bank becomes embedded in the underlying trade chain

If any part of the supply chain were later found to involve:

A sanctioned upstream supplier

A misrepresented origin

A circumvention structure

Or a future-designated party

the reputational and regulatory consequences could be significant.


My current thinking

Before proceeding, I would consider:

Enhanced UBO background analysis beyond basic sanctions screening

Deep supply-chain mapping (including upstream Russian counterparties and maybe downstream counterparties involved in Russia/Iraq etc)

Clear origin documentation and processing validation

Policy-level confirmation that Russian-origin metals fall within the bank’s acceptable risk parameters


Takeaway

The most difficult onboarding decisions are not those with obvious red flags.

They are the ones that look clean —
but sit at the intersection of geopolitics, commodity sensitivity, and trade finance leverage.

Always dig deeper and think harder.
